This folder contains 120" (3.05m) and 130" (3.30m) Open TD wings designed
around the same type of spar construction used on the Aegea 2m.  The airfoils
are natural larger-Re adaptations of Aegea's DLG airfoils, and are quite "fast".  
Hence they will favor very low wing loadings -- 7 oz/ft^2 or less.

The drawings show the stock Mantis wing for comparison.  The "Pretty-Mantis"
fuselage is a natural for these wings.  The 130" wing will require a larger 
tail, however.
