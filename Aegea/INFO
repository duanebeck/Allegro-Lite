Aegea is a fairly unique aileron 2m glider.  
It has the following distinguishing features:

* Very low weight (21 oz)
* High aspect ratio (12.6)
* Moderately low wing loading (6.2 oz/ft^2)
* AG4x DLG airfoils
* Relatively generous EDA (6.0 deg)

The main design goal is to achieve good thermalling performance 
via the low span loading.  The AG4x DLG airfoil series with 
full-span camber control are used to give good speed performance 
despite the low weight.  The large flaps and ailerons, when set
at about +20 degrees, give acceptable winching performance despite 
the unusually small wing area of 490 in^2.  The generous EDA makes 
the Aegea very easy to thermal, especially at large distances which 
is a major problem with 2m gliders.  The Aegea can be viewed as 
a natural 2-meter implementation of the latest DLG technology. 


The Aegea has proven to be a formidable structural challenge,
mainly due to the very thin wing and the large pitching moment
of the cambered flaps and ailerons on tow.  Everything is sized
for stiffness.  The aileron servos don't quite fit, so a careful
fairing job is necessary.  The flap servo had to be put in the 
fuselage.  This helps with CG, but gives a lot of mechanical 
complexitydue to the pushrod hookup and the flap torque rods 
and linked horns.

The Aegea II is a redesign consisting of a simple ~10% wing chord 
increase.  This greatly improves the practicality of the design, 
in that the structural constraints become much easier to meet.  
The sparcaps can be thinner, and one layer of Kevlar becomes 
sufficient for the center section.  The 4-servo wing is vastly 
simpler than the 3-servo wing with the fuselage-mounted flap servo.
The Aegea's tail has proven to be quite generous, so the same 
tail is being used for the Aegea II.  If you are considering 
building this glider, the Aegea II is strongly recommended.
