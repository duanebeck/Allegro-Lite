Documentation for  sparsect.xls  Spreadsheet
=============================================


Purpose
-------
The spreadsheet computes the structural properties 
of a beam structure which consists of a collection 
of structural members.  An example is a wing, with
sparcaps, webs, skins, etc.  Each member is assumed 
to have either a rectangular or a tubular cross-section.
All the members are assumed to be solidly tied together
in shear, so that they cannot slide past each other
in the spanwise direction.


Inputs
------
The data in the yellow boxes is input by the user.
Consistent units must be used.  Both English and metric
units are given for each spreadsheet variable below.

BM [lb-in,N-m]  beam bending moment, tending to deflect beam in y direction

y  [in,m]       vertical location of element's centroid from some arbitrary y=0 datum line

D  [in,m]       outside diameter of round element, D=0 for rect. elements

d  [in,m]       inside  diameter of round element, d=0 for rect. elements and solid rods

h  [in,m]       height of rectangular element,  h=0 for round elements

w  [in,m]       width  of rectangular element,  w=0 for round elements

E  [psi,Pa]     Young's modulus (elastic modulus) of element material

rho [arbitrary] density of element material, used only to display mass/span 


Outputs
-------
The data in the uncolored boxes is output.  
Do not change these, else you will clobber the spreadsheet.
Only the outputs of main interest are described below.
The rest are intermediate quantities used in the calculations.


Overall beam property outputs
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

ybar       [in,m]            y location of beam "neutral plane", 
                             where the material has zero bending stress

EI_total   [lb-in^2,N-m^2]   total bending stiffness of beam

w"         [1/in,1/m]        beam curvature  =  BM / EI_total

mass/span  [arbitrary]       gives total mass/span of all elements together,
                             for comparison to other beam configurations

EI/mass    [arbitrary]       gives overall stiffness/mass (i.e. structural efficiency)

EA       [lb,N]           axial stiffness of this element
 
rho A    [arbitrary]      contribution of this element to mass/span

EI       [lb-in^2,N-m^2]  contribution of this element to EI_total

sigmax-  [psi,Pa]         maximum compressive stress in element

sigmax+  [psi,Pa]         maximum tensile stress in element




Other Useful Quantities not Displayed
-------------------------------------

Tip deflection
- - - - - - - - 
If the spreadsheet corresponds to a wing center section under bending,
the tip deflection can be estimated by assuming a spanwise-constant
curvature, which is what nearly occurs if the structure tapers towards
the tip in an ideal manner.

  d_tip  =  w" span^2 / 8 


Material strain
- - - - - - - - 
Any material attached to the bending beam is subjected to extensional strain.
For material at location y, the strain eps is

  eps  =  -w" (y - ybar)

positive for tension and negative for compression.
