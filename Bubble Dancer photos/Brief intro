These pictures show the fuselage that I made.  The highest interest point will probably be the  picture showing the plug.  The whole structure with wings have to fit in the confined space of a gun case 52x4x13.  Questions?? happl@mint.net The vmount dry setup I hope will show people that it is not a difficult thing to do.  The colored paper was used to show the layers and  A pen was used to show the hinge pin. The v shaped wood block was the other form in the picture V parts and forms.  This was simply wrapped with tape. The carbon well dried after wetting was layed on it then black tape was used to hold it down while it set. The boom weighs 70g but is longer. The pod weighs 27 grams and the cone weighs 20 grams.  After the cutout was made for the servos a puddle of epoxy was poured in and rolled to the rear to surround the boom and help bond it to the pod.  The puddle was then run forward down the bottom joint and up and around the front.  Glass was then layed in the bottom on the joint from the boom to the nose.  The botoms of the servos are wrapped with masking tape and then were shoved into the puddle.  You cannot use any kind of poly for this since epoxy won't grip poly.  But the servos can be broken free from the adhesive of the masking tape.

The wing joints were made by cutting back three inches into the high load foam that was used in the spar.  They were filled with epoxy and West System light filler.  The joiners in brass were then thrust into them and they were jigged together at the correct angle.

Please note that this is an alternative construction based on an amalgamation of John O Sullivan (look up his page) and Mark Drela's Bubble Dancer (look up the folder) and a gun case available in the fall from Wal-Mart.
