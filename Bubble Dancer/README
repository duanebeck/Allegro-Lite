This directory contains all the Bubble Dancer drawings I have.
Many of the details have not been finalized yet, since the
prototypes are still under construction (as of Feb '01).
The BD construction method is identical to that of the 
Allegro-Lite, and the structural details are also essentially 
the same.  So please refer to the more detailed AL plans 
and construction notes for additional info.

Update (13 Sep 02):
I added DXF versions of the multi-sheet drawings.
These were auto-converted from the original source PostScript,
and are not aesthetically perfect.  Fonts are badly sized, 
hidden lines aren't hidden, etc., but they should come out
dimensionally correct and usable, especially if you also have
the correct multi-sheet PDF versions printed out for reference.
