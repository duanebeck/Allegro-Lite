================================
Wing layout modifications

Original wing layout
#  span    chord   alpha   z  
    0.     10.0    0.0    0.0 
   24.75   10.0    0.0    0.0 
   42.0     8.5    0.0    2.0
   54.0     6.0    0.0    6.7

Modified wing layout
#  span    chord   alpha   z  
    0.     10.0    0.0    0.0 
   24.75   10.0    0.0    0.0
   42.0     8.5   -1.0    3.0
   54.0     6.0   -1.0    7.5    |  suggested 1-bay extension with
   56.0     4.5   -1.0    8.25   |  curved LE a'la Allegro-Lite

where z is the height of the dihedralled-wing sections above the table

Mid panel now has 1 degree washout twist (TE at 8.5" chord raised by 0.15"),
while center and tip panels are still flat. 
 - improves tip stall margin (stock Majestic is prone to tip stall during slow circling)
 - reduces CDi by 2% at low speeds
 - little adverse impact on penetration capability

Effective dihedral has been increased from 8.3 to 10.2 degrees.
 - improves roll response
 - reduces the sideslip needed to hold a steady turn (and hence reduces drag)

More dihedral burden is now carried by mid panels.
 - improves tip panel stall margin when in steady sideslip in turn

Tip panels extended by 2" or more, with curved (swept back) leading edge
like that on the Allegro-Lite.
 - reduces CDi by additional 8% on top of washout's reduction
 - cleans up tip flow during steady sideslip in turn


In slow, tight thermal flying, the modified wing is expected to be 
more maneuverable, more docile, and give a 5-7% sink rate reduction.

If the wingtip extension is deemed to be too much trouble, then just
round off the last rib bay LE like on the Allegro-Lite.  The stock 
end rib is not used in this case.

--------------------------
Note (29 Sep 01): 
John Hayes has recently added the 1 deg washout to his otherwise
stock Majestic, using a heat gun.  He reports a major improvement 
in tight circling behavior -- the glider no longer tends to fall off 
onto the inside wing.

=================================
Tail layout modifications

Original tail layout
# span   chord   alpha   z
  0.0    7.5    0.0    0.0
 13.0    4.5    0.0    8.3

Modified tail layout
# span   chord   alpha   z
  0.0    7.5    0.0    0.0
 17.0    4.5    0.0   12.0


A 4" extension is added to the tip of each V-tail half,
and the tail V-dihedral has been increased from 40 to 45 degrees.

 - Effective horizontal tail volume is increased from 0.40 to 0.44
    + CG location can be moved back slightly from recommended position

 - Effective vertical tail volume is increased from 0.018 to 0.028
    + Yaw damping rate will increase by about 60%
    + Rudder roll power will increase by about 90%  
       (60% more rudder yaw power together with 22% more dihedral)

A simple way to implement this is to increase the rib spacing
to 2.4", and extend the spanwise wood via splices or just replace it.

=================================
Wing airfoil modifications

The SA7038 airfoil is somewhat overcambered for this glider.
It penetrates OK, but not as well as it could with a lower
camber airfoil.  One of two modified airfoils is suggested:

SA7038 mod 6
SA7038 mod 7

These differ in the severity of the LE upsweep modification.
Both airfoils have the same TE modification.
Specifically:

a) The bottom LE upsweep is increased slightly (mod 6) 
or significantly (mod 7).
b) On both modified airfoils, the slight undercamber of the SA7038 
is flattened by removing the rear 5% of the chord, and straightening 
the downward-curved bottom surface to regain the sharp TE.  This is 
simple to do with the Majestic's rib/TE structure.  The airfoil is now 
flat behind the spar which should simplify construction and covering 
somewhat.  The aspect ratio has also been increased by about 5%.

Mods a) and b) are cumulative, and only one of these 
can be implemented for a partial improvement.


The modified airfoils are quite similar to the MH32, but a bit thicker.
Compared to the stock SA7038, at 50 mph they will increase L/D by
30% or 40% (mod 6 or mod 7), dramatically improving penetration.
Float and winching performance will be only slightly degraded, 
but this can be easily more than compensated with a lower flying weight.

A lower weight is highly desirable to take best advantage of the 
new airfoils.  Consider using light radio gear and a carbon tube boom 
to eliminate any nose weight.  The elevator is unnecessarily beefy 
at the tip.  As you go out, use larger lightening holes than those 
shown on the plan.  Move the elevator hinge to the bottom and 
shorten the horns by 1/4".


=================================
Structural modifications

As minimum, beef up the spar.  My numbers indicate that to 
make it winchproof it wants 0.040" carbon on top, and 0.030"
or 0.020" carbon on the bottom sparcaps at the wing center.
These can taper in thickness outboard.  CST's or ACP's 
tapered carbon would work well.  Wrap this spar near the 
end of the joiner rod and at the root rib to prevent it
from bursting apart at these point-load locations.  The
shear web wants to be at least 1/4" total thickness of 
10 lb balsa in the center, this thickness tapering roughly 
linearly outboard.  With the specified carbon strips,
the spruce caps are largely superfluous, and could be replaced 
by hard balsa.
------------------
Note  15 Aug 05
See Adding_Carbon_Fiber.doc and .pdf documents for CF/balsa
replacement-sparcap techniques.
------------------
The sparcap carry-though method which is used on the outer 
dihedral break of the Allegro-Lite could be used for both 
breaks of the Majestic.  This is easy to install and vastly 
lighter than a ply joiner.

Minimizing yaw inertia should be the #1 priority 
for getting the best turn handling possible.  
The wing structure looks kinda beefy towards the tips 
which doesn't help.  I think you can progressively narrow 
the TE as you go out (lengthen the capstrips to reach it).  
A 3/4" wide TE should be fine at the tip.  Narrow the outer 
capstrips, maybe down to 1/8" in the tip panels.  
Use the lightest sheeting possible for the tips.  The extreme
outboard spar can be whittled down.  The beefy end rib can be 
replaced by the one-bay tip extension with a curved leading edge 
as described above, or just installing the curved LE in the last
rib bay.  Grams count at the wingtips!
