A piece of 3/8 or 1/2 inch thick plate glass 12 x 36 or 48 inches makes a fine

work surface for building flat bottomed structures and for beveling soft balsa

parts. Very few materials are as flat or smooth as a piece of heavy plate glass.


With the use of 3M75 repositionable contact adhesive, plans and parts can be
 
held flat to the surface for assembly or shaping. The 3M75 will not transfer

to the plans or work if allowed to dry first yet, it remains tacky enough to
 
hold things in place.


Spray one side of the glass and allow to dry. Lay down the plans on the tacky

glass. Spray one side of a piece of waxed paper or monocoat backing plastic
 
and allow to dry. Lay the tacky side of the waxed paper or plastic sheet on 

the plans. Spray the plastic sheet or waxed paper and allow to dry. Lay down
 
and glue the parts to be assembled. When the glue is dry the assembly can be 

removed without any residue. Peel the waxed paper or plastic off the plans. 

Peel the plans from the glass. The plans will be clean. Use a single edged 

razor blade to scrape off most of the adhesive from the glass. Any small amount

of remaining adhesive can be removed with Goo Gone (a hardware store item).


Any flat item may be held in place for sanding or planing by first spraying
 
the glass with 3M75 and let it dry. Then lay the work near the edge of the
 
plate glass and the tack will hold it in place for sanding or beveling.


For best results, use only a very light coat of 3M75, especially when working
 
with delicate parts.
