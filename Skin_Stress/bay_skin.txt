Stressed-Skin Sizing over Servo Bays
------------------------------------

A servo bay cut into the bottom surface of a stressed-skin 
removes much of the buckling support for the upper surface
skin directly above the bay.  This loss of support severly 
reduces the stress which the upper surface skin can withstand
without local buckling failure.

This analysis determines the increased local upper surface 
skin thickness which is required to compensate for the weakening 
of the servo bay.  The alternative method of using short CF rods
to stiffen the skin is also considered.

This calculation procedure requires using mostly the same relations 
as the skin sizing calculations, applied at the servo bay location.

Three-meter glider example...

  E = 20 Msi      uni CF skin modulus


  wing span    :  b = 130 in
  wing load    :  F = 150 lb      (winch line force)

  unsupported spanwise length of skin:
    case 1:   L = 0.5 in    (only over servo arm area)
    case 2:   L = 1.5 in    (over whole servo bay)

At servo bay location  (span fraction eta=0.2), MH32 (T/c=0.0866) ...

  moment factor:  a = 0.6     (from appendix table in file  skin_sizing.txt)
  stress factor:  f = 0.0449  ( "Ixx/t(Y-Yc)" from Xfoil, approx. 0.5*T/c)
  chord        :  c = 9.7 in
  bend. moment :  M = a b F/8 = 1460 lb-in
  skin load    :  P = M/(f c^2) = 345 lb/in


  minimum thickness of unsupported skin:  t_bay  =  1.2 ( P L^2 / E )^0.3333

    case 1:   t_bay = 0.0195 in   (4+ layers)
    case 2:   t_bay = 0.0290 in   (6+ layers)


--------------------------------------------------------------------
The increased local skin thickness may be impractical to implement. 
An alternative is to use CF rods buried just under the unmodified skin.
Each rod should be perhaps 1.0-1.5" longer than the servo bay.
The chordwise spacing of the rods must be set so that the resulting
unsupported structure has a buckling load comparable to the
surrounding supported skin.


  chosen rod diameter :  d = 0.060 in
  existing skin thick.:  t = 0.009 in


Rod spacings to match the required skin thicknesses from above...

For case 1...  
   required thick.:  tr = 0.0195 in
   rod spacing    :  s  =  0.6 d^4 / (tr^3 - t^3)  =  1.16 in

For case 2... 
   required thick.:  tr = 0.0290 in
   rod spacing    :  s  =  0.6 d^4 / (tr^3 - t^3)  =  0.33 in


These spacing estimates assume that the rods and the existing skin
are not bonded together, and contribute to the stiffness independently.
In reality, the fully-bonded structure will be stiffer than the 
sum of the parts.  The non-bonded assumption simply produces 
a smaller and hence more conservative spacing.
