Load Testing of Wing Skins (Updated)                 Mark Drela  14 Aug '04
==========================


Discussion
----------

* Objective:
To determine the failure load or failure stress of a given wing skin layup.

* Likely failure mechanism:
Buckling of the skin on the compression side.  
The foam core participates (i.e. also fails) during the buckling.

* Alternative failure mechanism:
Local compression fracture (fiber mashing).  This is unlikely,
except possibly at a fiber kink due to an oversize cross-fiber.
Weblets may stabilize the skin sufficiently to allow fracture
stress to be reached before buckling.

* Other possible mechanisms to be avoided in test, 
since they should not appear in a properly built wing:

  - Shear failure of the foam. Avoided with sufficiently long beam.

  - Delamination of skin. Avoided with a sufficiently good bond.

  - Tension-side fiber failure. Unlikely.


* Test article considerations:

The highest fidelity test is obtained with an actual wing, 
supported in the center and having a spanwise distributed load 
simulating the airload.  This is obviously not practical.

The next best simulation is just the center panel, supported
in the center, with load applied at each end (3-point bending test).
This is still not very practical.

We next consider sub-scale test beams. It now makes sense to make
such beams have a rectangular cross-section, for several reasons:

  - A sub-scale airfoil-shaped beam has sharper chordwise 
  curvatures than the real thing.  This will artificially 
  stabilize the skin against buckling, and hence make the 
  results overly optimistic.  In contrast, a rectangular beam 
  has no stabilizing chordwise curvature, and hence will be 
  pessimistic (conservative).

  - A rectangular beam has the same skin stress at each chordwise
  location, which simplifies the data reduction.

  - Rectangular beams can be made en masse on one foam sheet.


* Test beam sizing:

Consider a beam under 3-point bend loading.

Given:
l = half-length of beam
h = height of beam (skin separation distance)
w = width (i.e. chord) of skin
t = skin thickness
F = load at each end (center load is -2F)

Calculated:
P = load on skin  (compression P on top, tension P on bottom)
sigma = skin axial stress
tau = core shear stress

 P      =  F l / h
 sigma  =  P / (w t)  =  F l / (h w t)
 tau    =  F / (h w)  =  sigma t / l

We must make sure that shear failure of the foam does not occur.
The core shear stress tau must therefore be kept below its failure stress.
For Hiload-60 or Foamular-600 this tau_max is estimated to be about 40 psi.
The minimum length is then computed from the tau equation above, rearranged:

 l_min  =  sigma t / tau_max


The anticipated buckling stress sigma, from skin_sizing.txt writeup, is 

 sigma_est  = 0.57 (E Ec^2)^0.3333  =  0.57 (20e6 * 6000^2)^0.3333  = 50000 psi

so the beam half-length must be at least

 l_min  =  50000 t / 40  =  1250 t

Three layers of 3.5 oz CF will be about t = 0.015" thick, 
so the beam half-length must be at least

 l_min  =  1250 * 0.015  =  18"

With weblets, the skin stress will likely be significantly larger,
so the test beam length must be increased proportionately.
I recommend a beam half length of at least l = 24"  (48" beam).

For a given skin stress, the thickness of the beam doesn't affect 
the foam shear stress.  I suggest a beam thickness of h = 0.75" or so.
This will closely simulate the actual average wing thickness.

The width of the beam is somewhat arbitrary.  A narrow beam is convenient
to reduce the failure load F.  However, the beam has the free edges
which may produce premature buckling.  This can be eliminated by
making the foam wider than the skin caps.  I suggest w = 2" wide caps
on a 3" wide foam beam.  For beams with weblets, there should be 
a weblet located as close to each skin edge as possible, say within 1/8".
The wider foam will also give additional margin against foam shear 
failure.


Test Summary
------------

Beam dimensions
- - - - - - - - 
48"   long
3"    wide, with 2" wide skins
0.75" high

l = 24"
w = 2"
h = 0.75"

Skin layup same as on the center of the wing.  A tapered skin 
can be used on the beam, but this must taper no faster than 
linearly towards the tip.  

To save building time for multiple beams, the multiple skins can be 
laid up 1" apart on one wide foam slab, which is then sliced apart 
to make the beams.

The foam must be replaced with something hard at the three load points.
I suggest firm endgrain balsa, 1/4" thick at each end, and 1/2" thick 
in the center.  Wipe cabosil/epoxy into the endgrain during layup 
to prevent possible delamination from an epoxy-starved bondline 
due to wicking.


Test procedure
- - - - - - - -
While supporting the beam at each end, apply load L at the center.
The supports and load applicator should span the whole 2" width 
of the skin.  They should be at least 1/8" wide so the endgrain 
balsa core inserts are not indented.

Increase the load L steadily until beam fails, measuring it with 
a bathroom scale or whatever.  Note the L value at failure.

Stress computation:
F  =  L/2
sigma  =  F l / (h w t)

Weblets are expected to significantly increase the failure sigma
for any given skin.  Sample calculation for t = 0.015" (3-layer skin):

L = 100 lb  (estimated)
F = 100/2 = 50 lb
sigma  =  50 * 24 / (0.75 * 2 * 0.015)  =  53333 psi

This is the center sigma value.  The local sigma will decrease
linearly to zero at the ends.  If tapered skin thickness is used
on the test beam, it should be tapered no faster than linearly
to the ends.


Deflection:
The deflection of a loaded wing can be very reliably predicted, 
so there is little need to measure this in the test.  However, 
the test setup needs to have clearance for the beam center deflection d.  
Assuming the top and bottom skins are the same and uniform spanwise, 
this is estimated by the following formula:

 d  =  (2/3) F l^3 / ( E h^2 w t )

Sample calculation:

F = 50 lb
E = 20e6 psi  (carbon modulus)

d  =  (2/3) * 50 * 24^3 / (20e6 * 0.75^2 * 2 * 0.015)  =  1.36 inches

With a thinner bottom skin the deflection will be somewhat larger.


Alternative Test Beam Construction
----------------------------------
To allow using a shorter test beam, it is necessary to reduce or
eliminate the foam shear stress.  One way is to attach a sufficiently
strong extension to each end, and apply the load via a 4-point load setup:

        L
        |
        v
      _____ 
      F   F
      |   |
      v   v
======+===+======
^               ^
|               |
F               F

<--l-->


The test beam is only between the two center load points. 
It has a uniform skin load and zero foam shear.  The length
of the test beam doesn't matter, except for possible stiffenening
effects where the test beam attaches to the extensions.

The center load points would probably be applied via a single center
load L=2F with a cross bar, as indicated in the sketch.  All the 
calculations still apply, if we make the new definition

 l = separation of opposing load points on one side (length of extension)


Pros:
* Short uniform test beam
* No balsa inserts required (load is applied to the extension arms).

Cons:
* Extensions are more work


One possibility is to use 3/4" x 2" x 18" lumber for each extension.
The center foam core is 3/4" x 3" x 6" foam. The skins are 2" wide,
and extend onto the lumber for 1"-2" or so.

After the load test, the skins can be peeled off and the lumber reused.
