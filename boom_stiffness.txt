Measured boom deflection on M.Drela's Allegro-Lite:

 * Fuselage is clamped down onto its wing platform.
 * 2 lb weight is suspended from stab mount.
 * Boom deflection at stab mount is 0.56 inches.


Checking stiffness of new boom:

 * Clamp about 3" of big end of boom down to edge of table, 
   using wood blocks with slightly oversize half-holes.  
   Wrap tape around boom at x=0" and x=3" to snugly fit the hole.
 * Hang about 2 lbs of weight 24" from edge of wood (at x=27").
 * Deflection at load point should be 0.28"/lb weight.
 * If deflection is less than this, re-mount with less boom 
   being cantilevered, until deflection is 0.28"/lb.
 * Excess big end protruding from other end of block
   can be trimmed for a lighter boom
   (but make sure the remainder is long enough!)
