Below are the RD6000 radio settings I've settled on 
for my Allegro-Lite and Allegro-E-Lite.  For Airtronics
radio owners these should be a good starting point.
For other radios, they should give some indication
of appropriate settings to reduce trial and error
on the field.

The reduced Dual Rate 2 settings allow smoother flying
when going real fast, especially when you're not yet 
used to the glider's inherent quickness.  The downside
is that it's possible to forget to switch back to DR1
when you need the large throws for landing or tight 
thermalling down low.

I like to use the Flap -> Elevator mix, which makes the 
Flap switch into a "go" switch.  Flicking it forward changes 
the trim to a much faster glide for those long upwind runs.
This is especially handy when the glider is high directly
overhead and tweaking pitch with the stick is difficult.
Again, the downside is that it's easy to forget to put 
back to the slow glide position for the next winch launch. 
"Hey! How come it's not climbing steeply?!"
