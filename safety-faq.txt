I got a bunch of replies right away on the epoxy safety issue from folks who 
didn't know about the potential problems, so I figured I'd note a couple 
others that builders should be aware of.  Sorry for the extraneous message 
for the folks who 'already know all this'... 

CA "instant glues" 
Cyanoacrylates can be pretty nasty on the system with long-term repeated 
exposure.  There have been many tales of woe of folks on the exchange about 
folks who can no longer even be in the room where ca has been recently used. 
These really started coming out of the woodwork over the last couple of 
years.  The answer?  A respirator, ventilation, and lots of it.  Maybe even 
use something else... 

CA "odorless" 
You might think these are "safer", and they are a different formulation, but 
some folks have reported problems with these too.  There are some pretty 
problematic chemical formulations, from a health perspective, that are 
odorless - no smell doesn't necessarily mean safe. 

Carbon fibers 
Cutting that boom to length?  Maybe sanding a taper into it to lighten the 
aft portion?  Working with carbon fiber matting and tow?  Guess what? 
Carbon fibers love to break into close to microscopic sized particles that 
get embedded in your skin and lungs.  A good dust mask/respirator helps here 
too. 

Ok - I'm done with my soapbox, and again apologies if this is stuff that 
'you already knew', but based on the initial reaction to the epoxy comments 
I thought it important to make sure that all of our list members know how to 
build safely.  That way we can stay at it for a long, long time! 

Regards,
