Building Tools and Materials
============================
Last update  31 Oct 00


Essential
---------

* Heavy stiff straightedge.  
For stripping or truing balsa, lining up stuff, applying uniform 
pressure to a long seam, etc.  A good size is 1/4 x 1 x 18 or 24  
aluminum or steel.  A good hardware store should have bar stock 
like this.  For the A-Lite you will need two such 18" straightedges 
to spread clamping pressure uniformly to the top of the spar.

* Flat building surface.  Particle board won't warp, but must
be supported against sagging.  Heavy plate glass is best.
Building the A-Lite does not require pins to be stuck in the board.
Also, pin holes and pin dents in balsa cause significant stress 
concentrations, which is bad on this glider where everything is
pushed to the limit.  I used the straightedges and other weights 
to hold stuff down during assembly.

* Cutting tools. 
X-acto #11 blades.  
Single-edge blades (cheaper than #11).
Fine razor saw.

* Big and small triangles.  Metal or acrylic.  
For making square corners, getting stuff perpendicular to table, 
positioning dihedralled tips accurately over plan, etc.

* Long metal ruler.  At least 18", but 24" or 36" is better.
For measuring long stuff.  Can also be used for cutting.

* Sanding blocks.  Blocks for removing material using 80-220 grit
should be wood or metal (i.e. hard).  The "T-bar" blocks are good, 
but straight wood blocks about 3/4" x 2" or so are certainly OK.  
A long block is usually better than a short one -- just under 
11" in length to match sandpaper size makes sense.  
Blocks for polishing using 320-1500 grit should be slightly soft 
to allow conforming to surface.  Hard foam rubber or pink foam 
are good.  Soft blocks can be shorter -- 5" long works well.


Useful
------

* Dremel tool.  $50-80.
The most useful bits are the cutoff disk and little drum sander.  
The little optional chuck for drill bits is also useful.

* Drill press.  $80+

* Belt or disk sander.  $70

* Twist drills

* Long nose pliers

* Wire cutters

* Small triangular file

* Razor plane or sharp block plane

* Weights

* Spring clothes pins or small clamps

* Micrometer or dial caliper


Disposables
-----------

* dust mask

* mixing cups and sticks for larger epoxy batches

* Post-It Notes  (handy for small epoxy batches, stickable next to workpiece)

* nitril gloves (required for working with laminating epoxy)

* respirator (slows down sensitization to epoxy, CA, etc.)

* masking tape

* Saran wrap or waxed paper

* 3M75 repositionable contact adhesive for temporarily holding parts to 
  work surface for shaping and pinless assembly.

* Yellow carpenters wood glue (e.g. Titebond).
  Best for wood/wood joints.

* Model airplane cement  (e.g. Ambroid, Duco, SigMent)
  Best for splicing soft balsa sheets.

* 5-minute epoxy for low-stress small bonds.

* Slow epoxy (at least 30 minutes, but 1 hour or more is better)
  for high-stress and large bonds.

* Laminating epoxy for composite work.

* CA adhesives (slow, fast).

* Microballoons.

* Cabosil for thickening epoxy
